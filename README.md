# React Roguelike Game

[Live version](https://arcia125.github.io/roguelike/dist/ "Roguelike Dungeon Crawler")


## The Game
This is a game that I built using ReactJS Redux. My favorite thing when building this project was designing the algorithm to randomly generate the initial map. It generates a completely unique map every time it runs. The map it generates can be altered based on the settings you pass to the generateRandomMap function. Every map it generates will always be fully connected, there are never any separate sections. 

### Controls:
* W or Up arrow - Up
* A or Left arrow - Left
* S or Down arrow - Down
* D or Right arrow - Right
* L(kind of a cheat) - Toggles the darkness on the map, or the field of view.
* U - Resets the game to level 1
